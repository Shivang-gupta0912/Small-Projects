Project : [Amazon-Price-Tracker-Bot]
A Python-based Amazon price tracker that monitors a product's price and 
sends an email alert when the price falls below a specified threshold. 
This tool is perfect for snagging great deals and staying updated on price changes automatically.

Note : 
The program currently works with Amazon's website, but due to frequent changes in Amazon's frontend structure, 
future compatibility may require adjustments.Users can update the target product URL and
modify the scraping logic as needed to ensure continued functionality.
